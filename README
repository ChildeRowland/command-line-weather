Command line node application to get weather by city.  Users can enter city or allow ipinfo.io to get location via IP address.

To try it in the command line:

	$ git clone https://github.com/ChildeRowland/command-line-weather
	$ cd command-line-weather
	$ npm install

To see the options:

	$ node app.js --help

Print out the current temperature based on IP address.

	$ node app.js 

Alternatively, you can specify a city with:

	node app.js -l 'New York'

If the Open Weather Api recognizes the city, it will return the current temperature of that city.
